# Snake Game

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the Snake game in C. The game allows users to control a snake and eat hearts to score points. The difficulty level can be selected, and the game continues until the user decides to exit. Scores are recorded, and users can view their rankings.

## How to Play
1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Choose the difficulty level (Easy, Normal, Hard, God).
4. Control the snake using the following keys:
   - 'w': Move Up
   - 'a': Move Left
   - 's': Move Down
   - 'd': Move Right
5. Eat hearts to score points.
6. The game ends when the snake collides with itself.
7. After the game ends, choose to continue or exit.

## Difficulty Levels

- **Normal:** Fast speed.
- **Hard:** Medium speed.
- **God:** Slowest speed.
