## Games Included
The Infinity Arcade features the following five games:

- **Guessing Numbers:** A game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

- **Pong:** A classic two-player game simulating table tennis, where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

- **Rock Paper Scissors:** A simple yet engaging hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes (rock, paper, or scissors) to beat the opponent.

- **Snake:** A popular arcade game where the player controls a snake, navigating it to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

- **Tic Tac Toe:** A timeless two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to form a row of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- **Terminal Main** The central hub for Infinity Arcade is the Terminal Main. This is the interactive area where players can select and launch their preferred games. Users navigate through the menu using command-line inputs to choose from the available games and enjoy a seamless gaming experience.

## Key Features
